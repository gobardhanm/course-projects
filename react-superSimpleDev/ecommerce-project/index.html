    Routing:
      - It lets us create multiple pages in React.
      - Routing lets us create multiple pages using 1 HTML file.
      - This let's us re-use our HTML code.

      - We install React-router.
      - <BrowserRouter> added to main, where we're rendering
      - <Routes> component tells React all the pages that are in our website.

      - A single page index.html is shared across the all pages, it's called
        SPA (Single Page Application)

      - There are some shortcuts :
        - path='/' which is used for homepage, we can just write index.
        - We can use self-closing in Route components.

  =====================================================================================
    > When we click a link it reload the pages, as it was a multipages project,
     by default <a/> (link el) reloads the page
      
     - So, now we are using Routing, a SPA, we don't need to reload everytime, we can use JS
      to switch b/w pages.
      - To do this react-router provide a component called "<link>", it uses a prop "to", 
        instead of href of <a/>

    - When using react-router we should use <Link> instead of <a>
    - <Link> goes to another page without loading

      =====================================================================================
  > In this lession:
      - Started the Ecommerce project using React and Vite
      - Git : track of all changes in our code
      - Routing : Create multiple pages in React
      - Created the HomePage, CheckoutPage, OrdersPage
      - Updated all the links to work with routing
      - Separated the Header into a Component.

  > Backend:
      - fetch() : a inbuild function which fetches data from the backend
      - fetch is asynchronous, fetch returns a promise,
        promise : lets us wait for asynchronous code to finish.
        - It has a method .then(), which takes a func, 

        - .json() : gives us data attached to the response, it's also asynchronous.
          it is also a promise, so need to use .then()
