    <!-- What is React ?
- *external library* that *helps us* *create websites easier*.
- HTML code : creates a website
- How do we load JS onto our website ?
	- by using \<script> and write inside it.
	- or save JS in a file and load JS via script tag and src attribute.
	- script element can load JS from any src on the internet. (It does not have to local only) -> This is called external library (which is outside of our computer), code that someone else wrote and we are just loading it.
- To load *React* in our project:
```
<script src="https://---/react.js"></script>
<script src="https://---/react-dom.js"></script>
```

- Why are there 2 external library for React ? (react.js & react-dom.js)
	- React can be used in different places like:
		- Websites
		- Mobile Apps
	- React : have shared feature for both Mobile Apps and Websites
	- React-DOM : contain features specific to website

- So, to use React to create Websites :
	- load React & ReactDOM
- And, to use React to create Mobile Apps:
	- load React & ReactNative

    <!-- DOM (Document Object Model) :

- *document*.querySelector ( a feature of DOM )
- JS give us the document object which sort of combine JS and HTML together.
- It let's us put HTML element in JS and control HTML via JS.
 -->

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/supersimpledev/babel.js"></script>
    <script type="text/babel">
      const container = document.querySelector('.js-container');
      ReactDOM.createRoot(container).render('Welcome to SuperSimpleDev React Course');
    </script>
    <!-- To setup React :

- ReactDOM.createRoot(container ) : sets up React.
- To setup react we have to give it an HTML element. 
- Then we use, .render(), it means to display something, so it let's us display something inside that container
