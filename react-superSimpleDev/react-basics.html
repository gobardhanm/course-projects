    <title>React Basics</title>


    <!-- What is React ?
- *external library* that *helps us* *create websites easier*.
- HTML code : creates a website
- How do we load JS onto our website ?
	- by using \<script> and write inside it.
	- or save JS in a file and load JS via script tag and src attribute.
	- script element can load JS from any src on the internet. (It does not have to local only) -> This is called external library (which is outside of our computer), code that someone else wrote and we are just loading it.
- To load *React* in our project:
```
<script src="https://---/react.js"></script>
<script src="https://---/react-dom.js"></script>
```

- Why are there 2 external library for React ? (react.js & react-dom.js)
	- React can be used in different places like:
		- Websites
		- Mobile Apps
	- React : have shared feature for both Mobile Apps and Websites
	- React-DOM : contain features specific to website

- So, to use React to create Websites :
	- load React & ReactDOM
- And, to use React to create Mobile Apps:
	- load React & ReactNative

    <!-- DOM (Document Object Model) :

- *document*.querySelector ( a feature of DOM )
- JS give us the document object which sort of combine JS and HTML together.
- It let's us put HTML element in JS and control HTML via JS.

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/supersimpledev/babel.js"></script>
    <script type="text/babel"> // this tells bable to translate the JSX into JS

      const button = <button>Hello</button> 
    //   If we use DOM in our normal JS, instead of JSX, we use document.createElement and then use .innerHTML.
    // When using React we use JSX instead of normal JS

    // Problem with JSX:
    //  - Our web-browser doesn't understand JSX 
    //  - Need to translate JSX into JS, that's why we use 'bable ext lib'

      const container = document.querySelector('.js-container');
      ReactDOM.createRoot(container).render('Welcome to SuperSimpleDev React Course');
    </script>
    <!-- To setup React :

- ReactDOM.createRoot(container ) : sets up React.
- To setup react we have to give it an HTML element. 
- Then we use, .render(), it means to display something, so it let's us display something inside that container
      -->
<!-- What is babel ext lib :
 - A JS Compiler
 - Translate other languages into JS
 - Why babel is needed ?
    - When using react, we don't use normal JS, we use an enhanced version of JS called JSX

    - JSX : JavaScript XML
        - It's same as JS, but we can write HTML directly in our JS code.
